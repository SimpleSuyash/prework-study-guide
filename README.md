# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I want to be a developer/programmer. I want to do something that challenges my ability to use logic and problem solving skill. My current employment does not provide any such benefit or satisfaction. This Prework Study Guide helps me learn the basic of programming, and enables me to be familiar with the technologies behind building a website. This project made me believe that I might still be able to learn new computer skills and grow professionally. Also, it has tickled my dormant curiosity after years again. Building this website helped me learn gitHub from scratch. Also, I have started revising and relearning other technologies such as css, JS etc again.
